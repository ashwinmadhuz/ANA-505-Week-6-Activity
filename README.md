SVM Algorithm - A Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.

SVM accuracy: 97.33%

K-Means Algorithm - K-means is a technique for data clustering that may be used for unsupervised machine learning. It is capable of classifying unlabeled data into a predetermined number of clusters based on similarities (k).

K-Means accuracy: 88.67%

C50 Algorithm - C50 is an R implementation of the supervised machine learning algorithm C5.0 that can generate a decision tree.

C50 accuracy: 86.70%
